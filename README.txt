You can just run the program using python, the requirements are:
	32-bit python 2.7
	wxpython > 3.0 (<3.0 scrollbars don't work,TODO)
Once installed, in command navigate to this folder and then run, "[path-to-python]\python.exe tip_calculator_main.py"	

If you want to run the GUI program in eclipse and you have PYDEV installed, open the tip_calculator_main.py file in a new PYDEV project in Eclipse and click the "Run As" and then "Python Run"
